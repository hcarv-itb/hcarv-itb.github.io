=============


*Simulation Foundry (SFv2)* base objects are constructed with the **Project** and **Systems** modules.
The **Analysis** module performs tasks on single systems and agreggate results based on project hierarchy definitions.
The **Operators** modules perform actions on the system trajectories (**Trajectory**) and tasks (**Tools**) used by other modules.

Functionality is being imported from **Legacy**, a previous workflow for analysis (and submission) of GROMACS jobs.
